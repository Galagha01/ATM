Java ATM Program

## Overview

This is a simple console-based Java ATM program that simulates basic banking operations such as checking balance, making withdrawals, and deposits. The program is designed with a user-friendly interface and allows users to perform these operations using a four-digit PIN.

## Features

- **PIN Authentication**: Users are required to enter a four-digit PIN to access the banking operations.
- **Balance Inquiry**: Users can check their account balance.
- **Withdrawal**: Users can make withdrawals in denominations of $10, $20, $30, $40, $50, $60, $70, $80, $90, and $100. Custom withdrawal amounts are also supported.
- **Deposit**: Users can deposit funds into their account.
- **Card Return**: Users can safely return their card.
